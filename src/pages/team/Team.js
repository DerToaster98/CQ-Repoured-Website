Simply put, they needed sounds for things.' \nHe is currently the sound designer for the new sounds CQR has to offer. \n(Also dubbed the 'Noise Maker,' for noise he does make.) \n\nIf he were to describe himself in a way that does not give too much away ... \n'I am a caring, curious, cautious, human being.' \n'Technical to the limits of my own knowledge.' \n'Enjoys learning about things in all the scientific fields.' \n'Laughs at a lot of things.' \n'Likes cheese ... and chocolate.'</span>
